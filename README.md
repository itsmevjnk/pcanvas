# pCanvas - A Public Drawing Canvas Platform

This is a public drawing canvas platform (i.e. [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place) clone), originally written for the [SIT120 Introduction to Responsive Web Apps](https://www.deakin.edu.au/courses-search/unit-search.php?txtUnit=SIT120) unit.

This is only the frontend portion - also see https://github.com/itsmevjnk/pcanvas-backend for the backend.

## Getting started

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/itsmevjnk/pcanvas.git
```

Then enter the repository's root directory and install dependencies:

```
cd pcanvas
npm install
```

## Usage

To start a development server instance, which will be accessible locally on port 5173 (or another port if some other application is using it):

```
npm run dev
```

Static builds are currently broken for unknown reasons, so they are not available.
